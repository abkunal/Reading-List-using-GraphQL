# Reading-List-using-GraphQL  
  
A simple book reading list using React, Apollo and GraphQL.  
  
I made this application while going through the following tutorial. [GraphQL Full Course - Novice to Expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q).  
  
The application is live at [Reading List](https://graphql-reading-list.herokuapp.com/).  
  
To run this application locally -  
1. Clone the project.  
2. Navigate to server folder via command line and type `npm install` to install the dependencies.  
3. Create a mongodb database on mlab and replace in parameters in `index.js`.  
4. Run the server using the command `node index.js`.  
5. Navigate to client folder via command line and type `npm install` to install react dependencies.
6. Type `npm install apollo-boost react-apollo graphql-tag graphql --save` to install dependencies to communicate with graphql using react.  
7. Type `npm start` and go to `http://localhost:3000` on your web browser.
